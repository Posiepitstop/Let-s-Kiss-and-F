  <h1>Let’s Kiss and F？</h1>

  <h2>Peach Yogurt</h2>
  <pre>
[Verse 1]
I’m done with Whitey and Pinkie, they just don’t bite  
Need hands that leave marks, not blinking lights  
I wear lace like armor, blush like a bride  
But look a little closer, I’m begging inside  

Put some peach yogurt and taste it like a lollipop  
Didn’t say stop, but now I hope you don’t stop  
Control me like you mean it  
You know I’m soft but I fantasize  

[Chorus]  
I look like I pray, but I bite  
Say please, then beg all night  
Lipgloss smile, thoughts impolite  
I look so innocent  
But baby, you know it’s a lie  
I’m so fking bad inside  

[Verse 2]  
Losing my grace in the backseat blur  
Skirt all twisted, still calling you “sir”  
Cherry on my tongue, you learned in slow  
Said “Good Girl won’t”  
I said “I know”  

We stopped by that tree  
I still blush to name  
You held my throat  
But said it’s just a game  

At grandma’s house  
I wore white and lied  
You ruined me soft  
Where no one could find  

[Chorus]
I look like I pray, but I bite  
Say please, then beg all sight  
Tie me down, turn off the light  
You made me drip and cry  
You said I’m your quiet bride  
But I’m so fking wrecked inside  

[Bridge]  
Skirt all wrinkled from the ride  
One hand on the wheel but other on mine  
But they weren’t know  

I left my voice somewhere between  
The curve before his friend’s gate  
and the gasp he pulled from me  
It was quiet, but I think the wind heard  

[Outro]  
AND I WAS SO GOOD…  
WASN’T I?
  </pre>

  <h2>Sticky Little Leaf</h2>
  <pre>
[Verse 1]
I didn’t write a letter,  
I just left a  leaf.  
It wasn’t green or golden,  
Just something that could stick to things.  

It stuck to my sleeve,  
To your breath when you left the room.  
You never saw it,  
But it stayed—  
Longer than you knew.  

[Chorus]  
I didn’t need a savior,  
Just something small and real—  
And you,  
You are my sticky little leaf.  

Not loud, not strong—  
But you stayed,  
And that was everything.  

[Verse 2]  
I tried to press replay,
On days we didn't even name.
Wrote you into buttons,
Built you into rain.

And maybe that's how I survived-
Not by moving on,
But by moving soft,
Carrying the weight of "almost gone."

[Bridge]  
I didn't need a savior,
Just something small and near-
And you,
You are my sticky little leaf. 

YOu didn't fix thge cracks,
You did't promise me belief.
But you stayed
In silence.
And that was more than anything.

[Bridge]
To me, sticky little leaves aren’t just leaves.
They can be anything-
Someone who stays when everyone else leaves,
A silly toy that makes you smile through tears,
A shirt that smells like someone you miss,
And is all about you.

It’s not about spring.
Not about nature.
It’s about the small, quiet things
That don’t fix you,
But somehow
Remind you to keep going.

[Outro]
So I kept one.
Pressed it in a page.
Wrote your name
In lowercase.

Didn’t say “come back.”
Didn’t say “forever.”
Just—
stay.
a little.
longer.
  </pre>

  <h2>Stay</h2>
  <pre>
[Verse 1] 
I gave you all, you didn’t ask
But you took it like it‘s nothing
My voice, my time, my stupid laugh
My heart you held like it’s a game

[Pre Chorus]
You never said you loved me back
But I still stayed, still fed the flame
Now I don’t care what I might lack
Just use me—yeah, I’ll take the blame

[Chorus]
Use me, bruise me, drain me dry 
You don’t even have to lie 
Take the light out of my eyes 
I’m still here, I don’t cry 
You can take, and take and take again
I’m not asking if or when 
Just go on, break me 
While I still love you then 

[Verse 2]
Don’t need reason, don’t need to care
I’m past the point of wanting fair
It’s not about what I might lose
I stay because I choose to bruise

Don’t need a win, don’t need the prize
Just let me stay where pain survives
I’m not afraid to be unwise
This is my way to feel alive

[Chorus]
Use me, bruise me, drain me dry
You don’t even have to lie
Take the light out of my eyes
I’m still here, I don’t cry
You can take, and take and take again
I’m not asking if or when
Just go on, break me
While I still love you then

[Bridge]
They say I’m falling  
Been falling since then  
Maybe love, Maybe Need
I don’t know what is it

Let me lose, let me break  
Take whatever you can take  
I’m still here, not too late to be the one who stays  
I still love you, I just want you to stay

[Outro]
So come on, take it
This is what I do the best
